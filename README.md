# Train-Sim
A simulation of a train unloading dock made for an assignment in Fall 2020.

### What Is This?
This was an assignment for a simulation class I took in Fall 2020. The simulation tracks several entities (trains, crews, loading dock) and how they interact. A crew mans a train but works for a finite amount of time before "hogging out." A train with no crew can't move or unload. The sim calculates various statistics at the end and reports them.

### What's With The Two Versions?
There are two versions of the sim, the latter being better. The second sim was created with the simpy library and is process-based. The first sim is much more of my own code and is not process-based.

The first version contains the following files: 
 - train.py
 - data_structures.py
 - sim_setup.py
 
The second version contains the following files:
 - train2.py
 - process_classes.py

### Why Am I Uploading It Now?
I'm uploading previous coding projects that show how I code and how my coding style has changed over the years.
